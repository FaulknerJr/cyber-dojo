If you want to run this project


cd PATH/to/files

$ javac HundredDoors.java

$ javac main.java 

$ java main 

Addendum:
The code works semi properly right now. There is an error where the final door
	isnâ€™t in the proper position. I am not sure how to fix it. Pushing
	with hopes someone else may be able to figure it out.
